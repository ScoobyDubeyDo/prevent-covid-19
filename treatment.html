        <h2>What treatments are available?</h2>
        <p>
          There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19, and
          no vaccine is currently available. The treatment is symptomatic, and
          oxygen therapy represents the major treatment intervention for
          patients with severe infection. Mechanical ventilation may be
          necessary in cases of respiratory failure refractory to oxygen
          therapy, whereas hemodynamic support is essential for managing septic
          shock.
        </p>
        <p>
          On January 28, 2020, the WHO released a document summarizing WHO
          guidelines and scientific evidence derived from the treatment of
          previous epidemics from HCoVs. This document addresses measures for
          recognizing and sorting patients with severe acute respiratory
          disease; strategies for infection prevention and control; early
          supportive therapy and monitoring; a guideline for laboratory
          diagnosis; management of respiratory failure and ARDS; management of
          septic shock; prevention of complications; treatments; and
          considerations for pregnant patients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among these recommendations, we report the strategies for addressing
          respiratory failure, including protective mechanical ventilation and
          high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV).
        </p>
        <p>
          Thereâ€™s currently no treatment specifically approved for COVID-19, and
          no cure for an infection, although treatments and vaccines are
          currently under study. Instead, treatment focuses on managing symptoms
          as the virus runs its course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seek immediate medical help if you think you have COVID-19. Your
          doctor will recommend treatment for any symptoms or complications that
          develop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS are also treated by managing
          symptoms. In some cases, experimental treatments are tested to see how
          effective they are. Examples of therapies used for these illnesses
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>antiviral or retroviral medications</li>
          <li>breathing support, such as mechanical ventilation</li>
          <li>steroids to reduce lung swelling</li>
          <li>blood plasma transfusions</li>
        </ul>
