        <h2>Know the signs</h2>
        <p>
          The symptoms of infection for the new coronavirus are often similar to
          those of other respiratory virus infections, such as influenza.
          Symptoms can include fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Most people
          will only have mild symptoms, but some can become very sick. When
          person-to-person spread has occurred with other novel coronaviruses
          that caused diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS),
          it is thought to have happened mainly via respiratory droplets
          produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how
          influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. Spread of MERS and
          SARS has generally occurred between people in close contact.
        </p>
        <p class="more hidden">
          If you think you may have been exposed to a person with COVID-19 and
          have symptoms, before going to a doctor’s office or emergency room,
          call ahead and tell them about your symptoms and any recent travel.
        </p>
        <p class="more hidden">
          Depending on the severity of your symptoms, your doctor will determine
          whether or not you need to come in to be evaluated. Avoid contact with
          others and wear a face mask if you need to leave your home when you
          are sick.

        <h2>Keep things clean</h2>
        <p>
          Preventative measures are your first line of defense. The best way to
          protect yourself from COVID-19 is to practice good hygiene and to make
          these Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) recommendations
          part of your routine
        </p>
        <p class="more2 hidden">
          The source of the coronavirus is believed to be a "wet market" in
          Wuhan which sold both dead and live animals including fish and birds.
        </p>
        <p class="more2 hidden">
          Such markets pose a heightened risk of viruses jumping from animals to
          humans because hygiene standards are difficult to maintain if live
          animals are being kept and butchered on site. Typically, they are also
          densely packed.
        </p>
        <p class="more2 hidden">
          The animal source of the latest outbreak has not yet been identified,
          but the original host is thought to be bats. Bats were not sold at the
          Wuhan market but may have infected live chickens or other animals sold
          there.

        <h2>Maintain food Hygiene</h2>
        <p>
          The 2019 novel coronavirus causes respiratory illness, not foodborne
          illness — meaning it affects the lungs, not the digestive system.
          According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, there’s currently
          no reason to believe that the virus has been spread via food or food
          packaging.
        </p>
        <p class="more3 hidden">
          But officials still urge everyone to follow basic food safety
          guidelines that call for washing your hands before eating or preparing
          food, using clean utensils, and properly preparing and storing food.
          Restaurants and delivery services should also be following safe food
          preparation and handling practices.

        <h2>Cancel travel plans</h2>
        <p>
          The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends avoiding all
          nonessential travel to mainland China, Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
          Older adults and those with chronic medical conditions should consider
          postponing nonessential travel to Japan. For people at risk for the
          complications of COVID-19, such as those with underlying medical
          conditions or those who are older, it may be prudent to avoid any
          long-distance travel,
        </p>
        <p class="more4 hidden">
          he Foreign Office advised British nationals to avoid all non-essential
          foreign travel for at least 30 days. In any case, several countries
          have established travel bans, preventing Britons and foreign nationals
          from entering.
        </p>
        <p class="more4 hidden">
          Keep in mind, layovers at airports in these destinations also count.
          If a layover is unavoidable, the CDC recommends that travelers not
          leave the airport. Travelers with layovers may still be subject to
          screening and monitoring when entering the Country.

        <h2>Do general cleaning</h2>
        <p>
          In everyday life, you can reduce your risk of infection by maintaining
          good hand hygiene.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Start cleaning from cleaner areas and proceed towards dirtier
            areas. All surfaces that are frequently touched (e.g. door handles,
            armrests, table tops, light switches, water taps) need to be cleaned
            thoroughly and frequently.
          </li>
          <li>
            In public premises where people touch the surfaces, the cleaning
            should be done daily at least. If possible even more often e.g.
            between 2-4 hours especially during the epidemic.
          </li>
          <li class="more5 hidden">
            The public premises of workplaces must be cleaned using different
            equipment than the premises used by employees.
          </li>
          <li class="more5 hidden">
            Use a mildly alkaline all-purpose detergent for cleaning. The
            cleaning of sanitary facilities can be enhanced by using a
            disinfectant.
          </li>
          <li class="more5 hidden">
            Wear gloves to protect the hands when cleaning surfaces. After
            cleaning, the gloves must either be carefully washed and dried or
            replaced with a new pair.
          </li>
          <li class="more5 hidden">
            Use tight-fitting disposable gloves, for example, as all-purpose
            gloves. Long gloves must be used when cleaning toilets, and the
            gloves must then be kept separate from other cleaning equipment
            until they are carefully washed with water and detergent at the end
            of the cleaning round.
          </li>
          <li class="more5 hidden">
            Carefully clean the equipment used in cleaning at the end of the
            cleaning process.
          </li>
          <li class="more5 hidden">
            Use leakproof and easily removable bags in waste bins. Monitor waste
            bins and do not let them get more than three-quarters full. Empty
            waste bins daily, especially in public premises. The collected bin
            bags must be closed tightly and disposed of in mixed waste for
            incineration.
          </li>
          <li class="more5 hidden">
            Wash hands and forearms with water and soap when the gloves are
            taken off.

                breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs
