        <h2>What is coronavirus?</h2>
        <p>
          It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been
          encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to
          humans from animals. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared
          it a pandemic.
        </p>
        <p class="more hidden">
          Coronaviruses are a large family of zoonotic viruses that cause
          illness ranging from the common cold to severe respiratory diseases.
          Zoonotic means these viruses are able to be transmitted from animals
          to humans.There are several coronaviruses known to be circulating in
          different animal populations that have not yet infected humans.
          COVID-19 is the most recent to make the jump to human infection.
        </p>
        <p class="more hidden">
          Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause disease in animals.
          Seven, including the new virus, have made the jump to humans, but most
          just cause cold-like symptoms.
        </p>
        <p class="more hidden">
          Two other coronaviruses – Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) and
          severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) – are much more severe,
          having killed more than 1,500 people between them since 2002.

        <h2>How COVID-19 started?</h2>
        <p>
          In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases, caused by a newly
          identified β-coronavirus, occurred in Wuhan, China. This coronavirus,
          was initially named as the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) on 12
          January 2020 by World Health Organization (WHO). WHO officially named
          the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Coronavirus
          Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee proposed to name the
          new coronavirus as (SARS-CoV-2), both issued on 11 February 2020.
        </p>
        <p class="more2 hidden">
          The source of the coronavirus is believed to be a "wet market" in
          Wuhan which sold both dead and live animals including fish and birds.
        </p>
        <p class="more2 hidden">
          Such markets pose a heightened risk of viruses jumping from animals to
          humans because hygiene standards are difficult to maintain if live
          animals are being kept and butchered on site. Typically, they are also
          densely packed.
        </p>
        <p class="more2 hidden">
          The animal source of the latest outbreak has not yet been identified,
          but the original host is thought to be bats. Bats were not sold at the
          Wuhan market but may have infected live chickens or other animals sold
          there.

        <h2>How does it spread?</h2>
        <p>
          COVID-19 - spreads from person to person in close proximity, similar
          to other respiratory illnesses, such as the flu.Droplets of bodily
          fluids - such as saliva or mucus - from an infected person are
          dispersed in the air or on surfaces by coughing or sneezing.These
          droplets can come into direct contact with other people or can infect
          those who pick them up by touching infected surfaces and then their
          face.According to scientists, coughs and sneezes can travel several
          feet and stay suspended in the air for up to 10 minutes.
        </p>
        <p class="more3 hidden">
          Transmission is of particular concern on transport, where droplets
          containing the coronavirus could pass between passengers or via
          surfaces like aeroplane seats and armrests. The incubation period of
          the coronavirus, the length of time before symptoms appear, is between
          one and 14 days. Although not yet confirmed, Chinese health
          authorities believe the virus can be transmitted before symptoms
          appear, China where wildlife was also traded illegally.
        </p>
        <p class="more3 hidden">
          Close contact with an infectious person, such as shaking hands, or
          touching a doorknob, tabletop or other surfaces touched by an
          infectious person, and then touching your nose, eyes, or mouth can
          also transmit the virus.
        </p>
        <p class="more3 hidden">
          Reports raised the possibility that the virus may be spread by fecal
          contamination of the environment, such as through leaky sewage pipes.
          Infections across multiple floors of a building due to contaminated
          bathroom pipes was previously demonstrated for SARS coronavirus.

        <h2>What are the Symptoms?</h2>
        <p>
          According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever,
          tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose,
          sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. About
          80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as
          serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special
          treatment.
        </p>
        <p class="more4 hidden">
          In more severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia, multiple organ failure
          and even death.
        </p>
        <p class="more4 hidden">
          However, infected patients can also be asymptomatic, meaning they do
          not display any symptoms despite having the virus in their systems.
        </p>
        <p class="more4 hidden">
          Fever and cough were the dominant symptoms whereas upper respiratory
          symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms were rare, suggesting the
          differences in viral tropism as compared with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV.
        </p>
        <p class="more4 hidden">
          The elderly and those with underlying disorders (i.e., hypertension,
          chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cardiovascular
          disease), developed rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome,
          septic shock, metabolic acidosis hard to correct and coagulation
          dysfunction, even leading to the death

        <h2>How deadly is it?</h2>
        <p>
          With more than 8,600 recorded deaths, the number of fatalities from
          this new coronavirus has surpassed the toll of the 2002-2003 SARS
          outbreak, which also originated in China.
        </p>
        <p>
          SARS killed about 9 percent of those it infected - nearly 800 people
          worldwide and more than 300 in China alone. MERS, which did not spread
          as widely, was more deadly, killing one-third of those infected.
        </p>
        <p class="more5 hidden">
          While the new coronavirus is more widespread than SARS in terms of
          case numbers, the mortality rate remains considerably lower at
          approximately 3.4 percent, according to the WHO.
        </p>
        <p class="more5 hidden">
          This coronavirus is a new virus so we can only estimate the fatality
          rate of COVID-19 in these early stages.
        </p>
        <p class="more5 hidden">
          Based on what we can see so far, COVID-19 is far less deadly to
          infected patients than Ebola or MERS. However, the fact that this
          coronavirus is so contagious and has crossed borders means
          significantly more people are expected to die.
        </p>
        <p class="more5 hidden">
          For example, Ebola has killed about 11,300 people since its outbreak,
          a figure that COVID-19 has already surpassed. By contrast, we are
          preparing for 8,000 to 12,000 COVID-19 deaths this Summer alone.

          Meanwhile, Chinese authorities have effectively sealed off Wuhan and
          placed restrictions on travel to and from several other cities,
          affecting some 60 million people. Other countries have since followed
          suit with total lockdowns, closing schools, restaurants, bars, and
          sports clubs, and also issuing mandatory work-from-home decrees.
        </p>
        <p class="more6 hidden">
          International airlines have cancelled flights the world over. Some
          countries have banned non-citizens from entering their territories,

        <h2>Are you immune to it?</h2>
        <p>
          Viruses that spread quickly usually come with lower mortality rates
          and vice versa. As the virus is an entirely new strain, it is believed
          that there is no existing immunity in anyone it will encounter. Some
          level of immunity will naturally develop over time, but this means
          that those with compromised immune systems, such as the elderly or
          sick, are most at risk of becoming severely ill or dying from the
          coronavirus.
        </p>
        <p class="more7 hidden">
          Although the total number of deaths has now exceeded those recorded
          during the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome
          (SARS), the current mortality rate is much lower than that of SARS.
          The coronavirus mortality rate stands at 2.4 percent, while SARS
          killed 9.6 percent of those infected.
        </p>
        <p class="more7 hidden">
          If the virus keeps spreading, eventually so many people will have been
          infected and (if they survive) become immune that the outbreak will
          fizzle out on its own as the germ finds it harder and harder to find a
          susceptible host. This phenomenon is known as herd immunity.
        </p>
        <p class="more7 hidden">
          Vaccines create herd immunity too, either when given widely or
          sometimes when administered in a “ring” around a new case of a rare
          infection. That’s how diseases like smallpox were eradicated and why
          polio is close to being erased. Various vaccine efforts are under way
          for this coronavirus, but they may not be ready for more than a year.
        </p>
        <p class="more7 hidden">
          The coronavirus is new, so it doesn’t appear that anyone is immune to
          it: that’s what lets it spread and why it can have such severe effects
          in some people. For herd immunity to take hold, people must become
          resistant after they are infected. That occurs with many germs: people
          who are infected and recover become resistant to getting that disease
          again, because their immune system is charged with antibodies able to
          defeat it.

          Even those who recover from COVID-19 might not be immune forever.
          Unfortunately, we don’t know yet whether or not the body’s immune
          response would protect you from subsequent infection
        </p>
        <p>
          It is known that exposure to the four seasonal human coronaviruses
          (that cause the common cold) does produce immunity to those particular
          viruses. In those cases, the immunity lasts longer than that of
          seasonal influenza, but is probably not permanent
        </p>
        <p class="more9 hidden">
          The majority of virologists are convinced that recovered COVID-19
          patients are immune to the new SARS-CoV-2 virus after the infection
          has run its course. After all, the body's own immune system has
          produced precisely those antibodies during the infection that render
          the pathogen harmless.
        </p>
        <p class="more9 hidden">
          This all-clear also applies to those who had only a weak course of the
          disease and showed a few symptoms. Nevertheless, their immune systems
          reacted to the pathogen and produced the corresponding antibodies. A
          renewed infection with the new coronavirus is therefore highly
          unlikely.
        </p>
        <p class="more9 hidden">
          However,A small study of 12 patients discharged from hospital showed
          that two or three had reduced lung function and In some patients, lung
          function could decline by about 20 to 30% after recovery. Also the
          computer tomography have shown fluid- or debris-filled sacs in the
          lungs, which may get progressively worse as the illness develops.
          Nevertheless it is too early to confirm any long-term effects.

          Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern
